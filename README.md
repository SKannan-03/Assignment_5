# Assignment_5

For this assignment I created a small platformer game with obstacles. I added music and obstacles for extra fun. 

I edited the speed of the character to make my game faster paced, and more finteresting to play. It also can increase the difficulty. I also decresed jump speed to make it match the space theme and have low gravity.

Some challenges i had to overcome was trying to have the given code to work with my game.

I solved this challenge by first trying to debug it own my own and checking over my current assets and hierarchy. After this didn't work I asked for help from the teacher to debug and fix the code.
